# 🛡️ Network Security Setup Documentation

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Network Security Setup** project focuses on designing and implementing robust security measures to safeguard enterprise network infrastructure. This project simulates real-world network environments to test and validate security policies, intrusion prevention systems, and attack mitigation strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure network data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Implement and manage industry-standard firewalls and security protocols.
- Detect and mitigate unauthorized access and potential cyber threats.
- Simulate attack scenarios to assess network resilience.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Firewalls**: Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: Snort, Suricata
- **Network Monitoring**: Wireshark, Splunk
- **Penetration Testing**: NMAP, Metasploit
- **Protocol Analysis**: TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP

## 🔍 Implementation Details
### 1. Firewall Configuration
- **Palo Alto Networks**: Configured security policies to block unauthorized IPs and suspicious traffic.
- **Fortinet**: Applied granular filtering and VPN security settings.

### 2. Intrusion Detection & Prevention
- Deployed **Snort** to monitor live network traffic and detect intrusion attempts.
- Configured **Suricata** to prevent identified threats in real-time.

### 3. Attack Simulation
- Simulated DDoS and port scanning attacks using **Metasploit** and **NMAP**.
- Analyzed network resilience and response time to cyber threats.

### 4. Traffic Analysis
- Captured and analyzed network packets using **Wireshark**.
- Identified unusual patterns and potential security breaches.

## 📊 Results & Reports
- **Attack Simulation Report**: Detailed findings on network performance under attack.
- **Network Security Audit**: Comprehensive assessment of firewall and IDS/IPS configurations.

## 🚀 How to Run the Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-security-setup.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd network-security-setup
```
3. Run the firewall setup script:
```bash
bash scripts/setup_firewall.sh
```
4. Start traffic monitoring:
```bash
python3 scripts/monitor_traffic.py
```

## 📝 Future Enhancements
- Integrate cloud-based security monitoring tools.
- Implement zero-trust network architecture.
- Automate security audits with CI/CD pipelines.
